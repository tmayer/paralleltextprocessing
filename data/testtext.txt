41001001	Beginning of the glad tidings of Jesus Christ , Son of God ;
41001002	as it is written in [ Isaiah ] the prophet , Behold , * I * send my messenger before thy face , who shall prepare thy way .
41001003	Voice of one crying in the wilderness , Prepare the way of [ the ] Lord , make his paths straight .
41001004	There came John baptising in the wilderness , and preaching [ the ] baptism of repentance for remission of sins .
41001005	And there went out to him all the district of Judaea , and all they of Jerusalem , and were baptised by him in the river Jordan , confessing their sins .
41001006	And John was clothed in camel's hair , and a leathern girdle about his loins , and ate locusts and wild honey .
41001007	And he preached , saying , There comes he that is mightier than I after me , the thong of whose sandals I am not fit to stoop down and unloose .
41001008	* I * indeed have baptised you with water , but * he * shall baptise you with [ the ] Holy Spirit .
41001009	And it came to pass in those days [ that ] Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee , and was baptised by John at the Jordan .
41001010	And straightway going up from the water , he saw the heavens parting asunder , and the Spirit , as a dove , descending upon him .
41001011	And there came a voice out of the heavens : * Thou * art my beloved Son , in thee I have found my delight .
